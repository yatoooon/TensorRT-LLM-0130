## Inflight Benchmarking with a Dataset

This section covers how to benchmark TensorRT-LLM using inflight batching.


### Quickstart

For this quick start guide, we will focus on running a short max throughput benchmark on
`meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf` on a syntehtic dataset with a uniform distribution of prompts with ISL:OSL
of 128:128. In order to run the benchmark from start to finish simply run the following commands:

```shell
python benchmarks/cpp/prepare_dataset.py --stdout --tokenizer meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf token-norm-dist --input-mean 128 --output-mean 128 --input-stdev 0 --output-stdev 0 --num-requests 3000 > /tmp/synthetic_128_128.txt
trtllm-bench --model meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf build --dataset /tmp/synthetic_128_128.txt --quantization FP8
trtllm-bench --model meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf throughput --dataset /tmp/synthetic_128_128.txt --engine_dir /tmp/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf/tp_1_pp_1
```

And that's it! Once the benchmark completes, a summary will be printed with summary metrics.

### Workflow

The workflow for `trtllm-bench` is composed of the following steps:

1. Prepare a dataset to drive the inflight batching benchmark.
2. Build a benchmark engine using `trtllm-bench build` subcommand.
3. Run the max throughput benchmark using the `trtllm-bench throughput` subcommand.

#### Preparing a Dataset

The inflight benchmark utilizes a fixed JSON schema so that it is simple and
straightforward to specify requests. The schema is defined as follows:

| Key | Required | Type | Description |
| :- | :-: | :-: | :- |
| `task_id`| Y | String | Unique identifier for the request. |
| `prompt` | N* | String | Input text for a generation request. |
| `logits` | N* | List[Integer] | List of logits that make up the request prompt. |
| `output_tokens` | Y | Integer | Number of generated tokens for this request. |

> [!NOTE] Prompt and logits are mutually exclusive*
> While having both `prompt` and `logits` is not required, at least one is required.
> If `logits` are specified, the `prompt` entry is ignored for request generation.

Examples of valid entries for the inflight benchmark are:

- Entries with a human-readable prompt and no logits.
```json
{"task_id": 1, "prompt": "Generate an infinite response to the following: This is the song that never ends, it goes on and on my friend.", "output_tokens": 1000}
{"task_id": 2, "prompt": "Generate an infinite response to the following: Na, na, na, na", "output_tokens": 1000}
```

- Entries which contain logits.
```json
{"task_id":0,"logits":[863,22056,25603,11943,8932,13195,3132,25032,21747,22213],"output_tokens":128}
{"task_id":1,"logits":[14480,13598,15585,6591,1252,8259,30990,26778,7063,30065,21764,11023,1418],"output_tokens":128}
```

> [!INFO] A whole entry is on a line!
> To make the passing of data simpler, a complete JSON entry is on each line so that the benchmarker
> can simply read a line and assume a complete entry. When creating a dataset, be sure that a complete
> JSON entry is on every line.

#### Using `prepare_dataset` to Create Synthetic Datasets

In order to prepare a synthetic dataset, you can use the provided script in the `benchmarks/cpp`
directory. For example, to generate a synthetic dataset of 1000 requests with a uniform ISL/OSL of
128/128 for [Llama-2-7b](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b), simply run:

```shell
benchmarks/cpp/prepare_dataset.py --stdout --tokenizer meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf token-norm-dist --input-mean 128 --output-mean 128 --input-stdev 0 --output-stdev 0 --num-requests 1000 > /tmp/synthetic_128_128.txt
```

You can pipe the above command to a file to reuse the same dataset, or simply pipe its output to the
benchmark script (example below).

### Building a Benchmark Engine

The second thing you'll need once you have a dataset is an engine to benchmark against. In order to
build a pre-configured engine for one of the supported ISL:OSL combinations, you can run the following
using the dataset you generated with `prepare_dataset.py` to build an FP8 quantized engine:

```shell
trtllm-bench --model meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf build --dataset /tmp/synthetic_128_128.txt --quantization FP8
```

or manually set a max sequence length that you plan to run with specifically:

```shell
trtllm-bench --model meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf build --max_seq_len 256 --quantization FP8
```

> [!NOTE] `trtllm-bench build` reproduces benchmark engines for performance study. These engine
configurations are not guaranteed to be optimal for all cases and should be viewed as reproducers
for the benchmark data we provide on our [Performance Overview](../docs/source/performance/perf-overview.md).

Looking a little closer, the `build` sub-command
will perform a lookup and build an engine using those reference settings. The
look up table directly corresponds to the performance table found in our
[Performance Overview](../docs/source/performance/perf-overview.md#throughput-measurements). The
output of the `build` sub-command looks similar to the snippet below (for `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf`):

```shell
trtllm-bench --model meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf build --dataset /tmp/synthetic_128_128.txt --quantization FP8

The engine in this case will be written to `/tmp/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf/tp_1_pp_1` (the end of the log).

### Running a Max Throughput Benchmark

The `trtllm-bench` command line tool provides a max throughput benchmark that is accessible via the
`throughput` subcommand. This benchmark tests a TensorRT-LLM engine under maximum load to provide an
upper bound throughput number.

#### How the Benchmarker Works

The benchmarker will read in a data file or standard input (stdin) as a stream where a single line contains
a complete JSON request entry. The process that the benchmarker is as follows:

1. Iterate over all input requests. If `logits` is specified, construct the request using the specified
list of logits. Otherwise, tokenize the `prompt` with as specified by `--model $HF_MODEL_NAME`.
3. Submit the dataset to the TensorRT-LLM `Executor` API at as fast of a rate as possible (offline mode).
4. Wait for all requests to return, compute statistics, then report out results.

To run the benchmarker, run the following with the [engine](#building-a-benchmark-engine) and
[dataset](#preparing-a-dataset) generated above:

```shell
trtllm-bench --model meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf throughput --dataset /tmp/synthetic_128_128.txt --engine_dir /tmp/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf/tp_1_pp_1

## Summary

In summary, the general process for reproducing a benchmark point is as follows:

- Prepare a dataset: `python benchmarks/cpp/prepare_dataset.py --stdout --tokenizer $HF_MODEL token-norm-dist --input-mean $ISL --output-mean $OSL --input-stdev 0 --output-stdev 0 --num-requests $NUM_REQUESTS > $DATASET_PATH`
- Build engine: `trtllm-bench --model $HF_MODEL build --dataset $DATASET_PATH`
- Benchmark engine: trtllm-bench --model $HF_MODEL throughput --dataset $DATASET_PATH --engine_dir $ENGINE_DIR`

where,
- `$HF_MODEL` is the Huggingface name of a model.
- `$NUM_REQUESTS` is the number of requests to generate.
- `$DATASET_PATH` is the path where the dataset was written when preparing the dataset.
- `$ENGINE_DIR` the engine directory as printed by `trtllm-bench build`.
